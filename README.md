ELK Stack in Home Lab
This document explains the setup of an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack in a home lab environment. The ELK stack is used for centralized logging and data analysis.

Overview
In this setup, I've configured a home lab cluster to run the ELK stack. This cluster consists of multiple virtual machines or physical servers, each running a Linux distribution with Docker and Docker Compose. The nodes in this cluster are interconnected and set up to communicate seamlessly, enabling efficient data collection, processing, and visualization using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.

Components
Elasticsearch: Stores and indexes log data.
Logstash: Collects, processes, and forwards log data.
Kibana: Visualizes log data and provides a user-friendly interface for querying and analyzing logs.
This setup allows for comprehensive log management and analysis, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot systems and applications in the home lab.
